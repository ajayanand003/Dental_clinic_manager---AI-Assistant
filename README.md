# Dental_clinic_manager---AI-Assistant

conversational assistant for a dental clinic to streamline patient interactions, appointment scheduling, and basic database management. The system will leverage an LLM (like OpenAI's GPT) and a SQLite database. Below are the high-level requirements and functionalities.

Key Functional Requirements
Language Model Integration

Use an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) for conversational interaction.
Ensure the LLM can classify intents, extract relevant information from user inputs, and handle conversational context.
Database Setup and Management

Use SQLite to store patient information and appointment data.
Implement tables for:
Patients: Store fields like name, age, contact info, etc.
Appointments: Store fields like patient ID, date, time, and procedure type.
Conversation Flow Management

Classify user intents (e.g., new appointment, cancel appointment, query).
Dynamically determine the next question based on missing information.
Validate and verify patient details interactively.
Appointment Scheduling

Check availability for requested slots (mock functionality initially).
Schedule new appointments or modify existing ones.
Ensure procedural durations are considered in availability checks.
Patient Information Management

Verify if a patient exists in the database.
Collect new patient information if needed.
Development Guidelines
Code Modularity: Break down the system into distinct components:
Language model interaction
Database initialization and queries
Intent classification
Information extraction
Conversation management
Appointment logic
Reusable Functions: Design functions for repeatable tasks (e.g., verifying a patient or extracting specific information).
Mock Features: Use placeholders for advanced functionality (like checking availability) to be replaced later.
Logging and Debugging: Include logs to track conversation flow and database interactions for debugging purposes.
